    "Whilst common knowledge for most GenAI practitioners, different models may have significantly time-between-token speeds. That is, the time taken to generate each token, which is essentially the speed at which the model can generate the output. For example, GPT-4 is considerably slower than GPT-3.5, but has significantly more powerful reasoning capabilities.\n",
